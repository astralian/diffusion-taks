I want to done this task with to show skills related to task description and job description.
It's a small app but I want to show different cases.

* I implemented this flow: app starting -> load from server random dish -> make search and get search results -> get dish by id
* I simulate and design API. Of cause API implementation can be different.
* I added skeleton loaders for all requests.
* All requests handled for API error.
* Search also show loader.
* I implemented small store and reducer for demonstration and also for decoupling app elements. For example we can easy change order of dish description, social sharing block and ingredients. 
* All cause different app require different approaches
* Unfortunately Chrome v3 extension allow only 600px of height
